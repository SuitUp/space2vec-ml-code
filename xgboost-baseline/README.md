## XGBoost Comparison Model

We have given 2 files:

1. The iPython/Jupyter notebook file
2. The .py file outputted from iPython/Jupyter

This will give you a few options to play with. We recommend iPython/Jupyter notebooks as they are
more user friendly than terminal... but this is a README, we don't have control over you!

Everything else should be explained in the code/notebook!
