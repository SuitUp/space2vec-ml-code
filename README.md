## space2vec: Model Code

Check our the posts here: [space2vec.com](http://space2vec.com)

The project behind the code is talked about in detail throughout the blog posts. But this
is where the cool code stuff happens!


## Data
You can find the feature engineered CSV from the autoscan project (under the "Features" heading) site here: 
[http://portal.nersc.gov/project/dessn/autoscan/](http://portal.nersc.gov/project/dessn/autoscan/)


## Environment
We have supplied requirements.txt file which you can use to setup the right environment. This was made for Python 3.6, 
so if you are getting errors about missing versions or something similar try removing anything after the "==" for that
library in the requirements.txt and run again.
